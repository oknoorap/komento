### List

Sometimes you want to add numbered lists / bullet points in your comment.

```markdown
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

* Todo
* List
```

#### Output

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

* Todo
* List

Alternative syntax using `-` (dash):

```markdown
- Dashes work just as well
  - Like this
  - And this
```

#### Output

- Dashes work just as well
  - Like this
  - And this
