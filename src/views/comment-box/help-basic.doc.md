## Basic Formatting

Komento uses Markdown as a comment format, since it's a popular, readable and efficient format for discussion. If you're not familiar with markdown, please learn all basic syntax here: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/.

Markdown is a text format that will converts simple text and display it as HTML, for example if you want to make your text bold or italic just add `**` or `*` before and after text, without embed `<strong>` tag, why? because embed HTML in comment is dangerous.

* **Bold Text** `**Bold Text**`
* *Italic Text* `*Italic Text*`
* ~Strike Text~ `~Strike Text~`

You can also add emoji in your comment just put this code `:+1:`, it will print this: :+1: emoji.
